1. Git is a version control system that is used to create and track changes made within repositories. It uses a branching
system that allows the code to be organized and available to edit by more than one person. Git is often confused with GitHub,
which is simply a popular platform that hosts Git repositories.

2. Terminals are important as they allow programmers to control every part of the computer and allow them to carry out all
computer functions outside of program capabilities and internet browsers. It can seem complicated to use a terminal, however,
it is the most efficient way for a programmer to organize his or her code files for projects.

3. One benefit to using version control systems is that alterations to the code are able to be monitored and organized,
allowing different coders to compare and contrast functionality of the code. Another benefit to using version control
systems is that code is available to edit by more than one person, enhancing collaborative efforts. Another benefit to
version control systems is the branching systems that allows different code to be maintained at the same time.
